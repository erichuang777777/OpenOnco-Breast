# Migration draft — Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, NOS (DIS-DLBCL-NOS)

**Draft only. Not applied. Every clause below still needs a Clinical Co-Lead's sign-off (CHARTER Sec 6.1) before any of this lands in a real Algorithm YAML.** See `docs/reviews/fable-opinion.md` Phase 3 and `docs/reviews/dead-clause-cleanup-candidates-2026-07-04.md` for why even a routing-snapshot-clean change isn't sufficient proof of safety on its own in this repo.

## `algo_dlbcl_2l.yaml` ⚠️ **step 1 entirely prose — every patient falls through to default_indication**

- **`all_of[1]`** (step 1, MIXED_ALL): `condition: "First relapse, chemosensitive disease (≥PR to salvage)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[0]`** (step 2, MIXED_ALL): `condition: "≥2 prior systemic lines failed"`
  - Confidence: **HIGH_CONFIDENCE_RENAME** — Likely mechanical rename — still needs a clinician's confirmation (polarity, threshold, and any dropped qualifier are not checked).
  - Proposed rewrite (unreviewed): `{finding: "prior_lines"}`
  - Candidate finding key(s): `prior_lines`
- **`all_of[4]`** (step 2, MIXED_ALL): `condition: "CD19+ disease confirmed"`
  - Confidence: **HIGH_CONFIDENCE_RENAME** — Likely mechanical rename — still needs a clinician's confirmation (polarity, threshold, and any dropped qualifier are not checked).
  - Proposed rewrite (unreviewed): `{finding: "disease"}`
  - Candidate finding key(s): `disease`
