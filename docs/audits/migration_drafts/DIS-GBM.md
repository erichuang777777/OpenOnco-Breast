# Migration draft — Glioblastoma (IDH-WT, WHO grade 4) (DIS-GBM)

**Draft only. Not applied. Every clause below still needs a Clinical Co-Lead's sign-off (CHARTER Sec 6.1) before any of this lands in a real Algorithm YAML.** See `docs/reviews/fable-opinion.md` Phase 3 and `docs/reviews/dead-clause-cleanup-candidates-2026-07-04.md` for why even a routing-snapshot-clean change isn't sufficient proof of safety on its own in this repo.

## `algo_gbm_newly_diagnosed_1l.yaml` ⚠️ **step 1 entirely prose — every patient falls through to default_indication**

- **`all_of[0]`** (step 1, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "IDH-WT confirmed (IDH1 R132H IHC negative + IDH1/2 sequencing)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[0]`** (step 2, MIXED_ALL): `condition: "Age < 70"`
  - Confidence: **HIGH_CONFIDENCE_RENAME** — Likely mechanical rename — still needs a clinician's confirmation (polarity, threshold, and any dropped qualifier are not checked).
  - Proposed rewrite (unreviewed): `{finding: "age"}`
  - Candidate finding key(s): `age`
- **`all_of[0]`** (step 3, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "MGMT promoter methylated"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.

## `algo_gbm_recurrent.yaml` ⚠️ **step 1 entirely prose — every patient falls through to default_indication**

- **`any_of[0]`** (step 1, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "No available clinical trial OR patient declines trial"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
- **`any_of[0]`** (step 2, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Progression confirmed on MRI (RANO criteria) OR biopsy-confirmed recurrence"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`any_of[1]`** (step 2, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Pseudoprogression excluded (>12 weeks from end of RT, or biopsy)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[0]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "MGMT promoter methylated"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[1]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "Prior TMZ completed (≥6 adjuvant cycles or discontinued due to progression)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[2]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "No prior bevacizumab"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
