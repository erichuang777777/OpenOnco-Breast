# Migration draft — Testicular germ cell tumor (GCT) (DIS-TESTICULAR-GCT)

**Draft only. Not applied. Every clause below still needs a Clinical Co-Lead's sign-off (CHARTER Sec 6.1) before any of this lands in a real Algorithm YAML.** See `docs/reviews/fable-opinion.md` Phase 3 and `docs/reviews/dead-clause-cleanup-candidates-2026-07-04.md` for why even a routing-snapshot-clean change isn't sufficient proof of safety on its own in this repo.

## `algo_gct_metastatic_1l.yaml` ⚠️ **step 1 entirely prose — every patient falls through to default_indication**

- **`any_of[0]`** (step 1, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Radical inguinal orchiectomy completed (or contraindicated by urgency)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
- **`all_of[0]`** (step 2, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "Post-orchiectomy serum AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH measured"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[1]`** (step 2, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "CT CAP completed for staging"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[2].any_of[0]`** (step 2, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Stage II (retroperitoneal lymph node involvement)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[2].any_of[1]`** (step 2, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Stage III (distant metastases or above-diaphragm nodes)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
  - Candidate finding key(s): `stage_iii`
- **`all_of[2].any_of[2]`** (step 2, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Stage I with rising markers post-orchiectomy"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
- **`any_of[0]`** (step 3, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "AFP normal AND histology confirmed as pure seminoma"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`any_of[0]`** (step 4, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Baseline DLCO ≥80% predicted AND CrCl ≥50 mL/min"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.

## `algo_gct_salvage_2l.yaml` ⚠️ **step 1 entirely prose — every patient falls through to default_indication**

- **`any_of[0]`** (step 1, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Prior cisplatin-containing chemotherapy received (BEP or EP 1L)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`any_of[0]`** (step 2, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Cisplatin-refractory: disease progression during BEP/EP OR within 4 weeks of last cisplatin administration"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`any_of[0]`** (step 3, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Poor Indiana prognostic score: AFP ≥1000 ng/mL OR hCG ≥1000 IU/L at relapse"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`any_of[1]`** (step 3, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Liver, bone, or brain metastases at relapse"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
  - Candidate finding key(s): `brain_metastases`
- **`any_of[2]`** (step 3, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "Incomplete response to 1L (AFP/hCG never normalized after BEP completion)"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[0]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "ECOG PS 0-1"`
  - Confidence: **HIGH_CONFIDENCE_RENAME** — Likely mechanical rename — still needs a clinician's confirmation (polarity, threshold, and any dropped qualifier are not checked).
  - Proposed rewrite (unreviewed): `{finding: "ecog_status"}`
  - Candidate finding key(s): `ecog_status`
- **`all_of[1]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "LVEF ≥45%"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
- **`all_of[2]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "CrCl ≥30 mL/min"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
- **`all_of[3]`** (step 4, SOLE_ALL): `condition: "ASCT-capable center accessible"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_NEW_FINDING** — No candidate finding key exists in the KB — needs a new biomarker/RedFlag/questionnaire field before this can route on anything.
