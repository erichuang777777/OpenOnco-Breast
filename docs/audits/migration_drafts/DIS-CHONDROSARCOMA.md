# Migration draft — Chondrosarcoma (DIS-CHONDROSARCOMA)

**Draft only. Not applied. Every clause below still needs a Clinical Co-Lead's sign-off (CHARTER Sec 6.1) before any of this lands in a real Algorithm YAML.** See `docs/reviews/fable-opinion.md` Phase 3 and `docs/reviews/dead-clause-cleanup-candidates-2026-07-04.md` for why even a routing-snapshot-clean change isn't sufficient proof of safety on its own in this repo.

## `algo_chondrosarcoma_1l.yaml` ⚠️ **step 1 entirely prose — every patient falls through to default_indication**

- **`any_of[0]`** (step 1, SOLE_ANY): `condition: "ECOG 0-2 AND advanced/unresectable/metastatic"`
  - Confidence: **NEEDS_CLINICAL_JUDGMENT** — No gene/biomarker-shaped token found — this is vague descriptive prose that needs a clinician to define an operational threshold.
  - Candidate finding key(s): `ecog_status`
